/** <module> Revolutionary Cognitive Architecture Demonstration
 *
 * This module provides comprehensive demonstrations of the revolutionary
 * grounded cognitive architecture that combines:
 * 1. FSM Engine with 17+ mathematical reasoning strategies
 * 2. Grounded arithmetic eliminating arithmetic backstops
 * 3. Modal logic integration with embodied cognition
 * 4. Grounded fractional arithmetic with nested unit representation
 * 5. Cognitive cost tracking throughout all operations
 *
 * This represents a paradigm shift from numerical computation to
 * embodied cognitive modeling of mathematical reasoning.
