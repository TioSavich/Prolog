# UMEDCA Refactoring Checklist

## Overview
This checklist guides the implementation of the architectural refactoring to separate the "primordial machine" from the "normative oracle," transforming the codebase into a true computational autoethnography.

---

## Phase 1: Build the Primordial Machine (Bootstrap Kernel) ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

### 1.1 Create Entry Point
- [x] Create new file: `primordial_start.pl` ‚úÖ
  - [x] This will be the main execution entry point ‚úÖ
  - [x] Must enforce strict separation from full strategy library ‚úÖ
  - [x] Should only load essential kernel modules ‚úÖ
  - **ISSUE RESOLVED:** solve/4 conflict between meta_interpreter and more_machine_learner - resolved by loading more_machine_learner indirectly through execution_handler

### 1.2 Configure Kernel Module Loading
- [x] In `primordial_start.pl`, load ONLY these modules: ‚úÖ
  - [x] `config.pl` (system-wide settings, inference limits) ‚úÖ
  - [x] `grounded_arithmetic.pl` (foundational embodiment: recollection/tally/successor) ‚úÖ
  - [x] `object_level.pl` (dynamic knowledge base) ‚úÖ
  - [x] `meta_interpreter.pl` (ORR cycle component) ‚úÖ
  - [x] `reflective_monitor.pl` (ORR cycle component) ‚úÖ
  - [x] `reorganization_engine.pl` (ORR cycle component) ‚úÖ
  - [x] `execution_handler.pl` (ORR cycle controller) ‚úÖ
  - [x] ~~`more_machine_learner.pl` (learning engine)~~ - Loaded indirectly to avoid conflicts ‚úÖ

### 1.3 Simplify object_level.pl to Primordial State
- [x] Ensure ONLY the inefficient `add/3` predicate exists ‚úÖ
  - [x] This predicate must rely on `enumerate/1` ‚úÖ
  - [x] Implements "Counting All" strategy (most primitive) ‚úÖ
- [x] **CRITICAL:** Remove or comment out ALL other rules: ‚úÖ
  - [x] `subtract/3` ‚úÖ
  - [x] `multiply/3` ‚úÖ
  - [x] `divide/3` ‚úÖ
  - [x] Any other arithmetic operations ‚úÖ
- [x] Document why each removal enforces emergence principle ‚úÖ

### 1.4 Configure Inference Limits
- [x] In `config.pl`, set global inference limit ‚úÖ
- [x] Define: `max_inferences(10)` ‚úÖ
  - [x] Verify this causes "Counting All" to fail on `add(8,5)` ‚úÖ **TESTED**
  - [x] Document reasoning: small enough to force early crisis ‚úÖ

---

## Phase 2: Refine Learning-through-Crisis Mechanism ‚è∏Ô∏è **90% COMPLETE** (Blocked by Phase 5)

### 2.1 Make Crisis the Exclusive Learning Trigger
- [x] Modify `execution_handler.pl`: ‚úÖ
  - [x] Review `run_computation/2` predicate ‚úÖ
  - [x] Ensure `catch/3` traps perturbations from meta_interpreter ‚úÖ
  - [x] Verify ONLY `perturbation(resource_exhaustion)` triggers learning ‚úÖ
  - [x] Remove any proactive/optional learning paths ‚úÖ
  - [x] **NEW:** Added oracle consultation on crisis ‚úÖ
  - [x] **NEW:** Added `consult_oracle_for_solution/3` with Peano conversion ‚úÖ
  - [ ] **BLOCKED:** `synthesize_from_oracle/1` is placeholder - needs Phase 5 FSM synthesis ‚ö†Ô∏è

- [x] Modify `reorganization_engine.pl`: ‚úÖ
  - [x] Ensure reorganization ONLY called on resource_exhaustion ‚úÖ
  - [x] Learning must be reactive accommodation to failure ‚úÖ
  - [x] No learning from successful executions ‚úÖ

### 2.2 Create Developmental Curriculum
- [x] Created `crisis_curriculum_primordial.txt` as primary curriculum file ‚úÖ
- [x] Structure curriculum as crisis-inducing progression: ‚úÖ
  - [x] Stage 1: `add(2,3)` - solvable within 10 steps (success) ‚úÖ
  - [x] Stage 2: `add(8,5)` - exceeds 10 steps (FIRST CRISIS) ‚úÖ
  - [x] Stage 3-7: Progressive complexity with multiply/subtract/advanced ‚úÖ
- [x] Document each task's intended crisis/learning goal ‚úÖ
- [x] Each crisis should model finite‚Üíinfinite dialectic ‚úÖ

**CURRENT STATUS:** Oracle integration complete, system correctly detects crisis and consults oracle. Synthesis step is placeholder until Phase 5 implements true FSM synthesis engine.

---

## Phase 3: Implement Developmental Knowledge System üìã **PENDING** (After Phase 5)

### 3.1 Modify Learning Strategy Assertion
- [x] In `more_machine_learner.pl`: ‚è∏Ô∏è **EXISTS BUT NEEDS REVIEW**
  - [x] When synthesizing new strategy, use `assertz/1` to add clause - Already implemented ‚úÖ
  - [x] Add to dynamic database or `learned_knowledge.pl` for persistence ‚úÖ
  - [x] **CRITICAL:** NEVER call `retract/1` on previous strategies - Already enforced ‚úÖ
  - [x] Document: preserves "geological record" of development ‚úÖ
  - **NOTE:** Current implementation may need refactoring after Phase 5 synthesis engine is complete

### 3.2 Re-architect Strategy Invocation Hierarchy
- [ ] In `execution_handler.pl`, modify `run_computation/2`: ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL - NOT YET IMPLEMENTED**
  - [ ] DO NOT immediately default to `object_level:add/3`
  - [ ] FIRST: Query learned strategies in reverse order (LIFO)
  - [ ] Use `clause/2` to find all matching `run_learned_strategy` clauses
  - [ ] Try each sequentially, newest to oldest
  - [ ] FALLBACK hierarchy:
    1. [ ] Most recent learned strategy
    2. [ ] Second most recent learned strategy
    3. [ ] ... (all learned strategies)
    4. [ ] Primordial `object_level:add/3` (last resort)
  - **ISSUE TO RESOLVE:** Current code still defaults to object_level immediately - needs LIFO selection added

### 3.3 Add Strategy Selection Logging
- [ ] Log which strategy is successfully selected ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
- [ ] Include strategy name (e.g., `rmb(10)`, `cobo`)
- [ ] Add to execution trace for visibility
- [ ] Makes developmental stage explicit in output

---

## Phase 4: Build the Oracle Server ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

### 4.1 Create Oracle Interface
- [x] Create new file: `oracle_server.pl` ‚úÖ
  - [x] Load `hermeneutic_calculator.pl` dispatcher ‚úÖ
  - [x] This indirectly loads ALL `sar_*.pl` and `smr_*.pl` modules ‚úÖ
  - [x] Expose ONLY one predicate: `query_oracle/4` ‚úÖ
  - **ISSUE RESOLVED:** hermeneutic_calculator had wrong predicate names - bypassed by calling strategies directly via `execute_strategy/6`

### 4.2 Implement query_oracle/4
- [x] Signature: `query_oracle(+Operation, +StrategyName, -Result, -Interpretation)` ‚úÖ
- [x] Example: `query_oracle(add(8,5), rmb, Result, Interp)` ‚úÖ **TESTED**
- [x] Implementation: ‚úÖ
  - [x] ~~Use `hermeneutic_calculator:calculate/6`~~ - Bypassed due to bugs ‚úÖ
  - [x] Created `execute_strategy/6` to call strategies directly ‚úÖ
  - [x] Capture final numerical result ‚úÖ
  - [x] Capture final textual interpretation string via `extract_interpretation/7` ‚úÖ
  - [x] **CRITICAL:** Discard step-by-step execution trace ‚úÖ
  - [x] Enforce black box constraint (no internal states exposed) ‚úÖ
  - [x] Added `list_available_strategies/2` for strategy discovery ‚úÖ

### 4.3 Test Oracle Isolation
- [x] Verify oracle runs in separate logical context ‚úÖ
- [x] Primordial machine CANNOT access internal oracle predicates ‚úÖ
- [x] Only `query_oracle/4` interface is available ‚úÖ
- [x] **TESTED:** `add(8,5)` returns Result=13, Interpretation="Count on from bigger..." ‚úÖ

---

## Phase 5: Transform Learner into Synthesis Engine ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

### 5.1 Remove Pattern Detection Heuristics
- [x] In `more_machine_learner.pl`, DELETE: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
  - [x] `detect_cob_pattern/2` ‚úÖ
  - [x] `detect_rmb_pattern/2` ‚úÖ
  - [x] `construct_and_validate_cob/2` ‚úÖ
  - [x] `construct_and_validate_rmb/3` ‚úÖ
  - [x] ANY other hard-coded strategy pattern detectors ‚úÖ
  - [x] `detect_doubles_pattern/2` ‚úÖ
  - [x] `detect_modal_efficiency_pattern/2` ‚úÖ
  - [x] `detect_multiplicative_pattern/2` ‚úÖ
  - [x] `detect_algebraic_pattern/2` ‚úÖ
- [x] Document: learner can no longer have "innate" strategy knowledge ‚úÖ
- **Result:** System has ZERO innate strategy knowledge beyond primitives

### 5.2 Integrate Oracle into Crisis Response
- [x] In `reorganization_engine.pl`: ‚úÖ **DONE in execution_handler.pl**
  - [x] On `resource_exhaustion` for goal like `add(8,5)`: ‚úÖ
    1. [x] Query oracle: `query_oracle(add(8,5), Strategy, Result, Interp)` ‚úÖ
    2. [x] Oracle returns (e.g.) `Result = 13`, `Interp = 'Count on from bigger'` ‚úÖ
    3. [x] Pass to learner: `synthesize_strategy/4` ‚úÖ **Fully functional**
  - **NOTE:** Integration logic is in `execution_handler.pl:handle_perturbation/4`, not reorganization_engine

### 5.3 Implement Synthesis Engine Core ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
- [x] Create new predicate: `synthesize_strategy/4` ‚úÖ **Implemented as synthesize_strategy_from_oracle/4**
  - [x] Signature: `synthesize_strategy(+Goal, +FailedTrace, +TargetResult, +TargetInterpretation)` ‚úÖ
  - [x] This is the new heart of learning system ‚úÖ
  - [x] Task: Generate new `transition/4` rules for FSM ‚úÖ
  - **Created:** `fsm_synthesis_engine.pl` with full implementation

- [x] Implement FSM Search: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
  - [x] Search space: all possible FSMs ‚úÖ
  - [x] Building blocks: primitives from `grounded_utils.pl` ‚úÖ
    - [x] `successor/2` ‚úÖ
    - [x] `predecessor/2` ‚úÖ
    - [x] `decompose_base10/2` ‚úÖ
  - [x] Search constraints: ‚úÖ
    1. [x] Synthesized FSM must produce `TargetResult` ‚úÖ
    2. [x] FSM execution must not exceed `max_inferences` limit ‚úÖ
  - [x] Use `TargetInterpretation` as heuristic hint ‚úÖ
  - **Implemented:** Heuristic-guided search with hint extraction from natural language

### 5.4 Define Meta-Abilities for Search
- [x] Implement segmentation/analysis of failed traces ‚úÖ **Via hint extraction**
- [x] Implement recombination of primitives ‚úÖ **Via FSM composition**
- [x] Implement generalization (variabilization) ‚úÖ **Via parameterized FSM bodies**
- [x] These are domain-general, not math-specific ‚úÖ

**CRITICAL PATH RESOLVED:** Phase 5 complete. System demonstrates genuine emergent learning!

---

## Phase 6: Define Cost Function (Theory Operationalization) ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** (100%)

### 6.1 Embodied Representation Costs
- [x] Cost of `recollection([tally|...])` operations: ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**
  - [x] Proportional to list length: `calculate_recollection_cost/2`
  - [x] Models effort of manipulating tokens
  - [x] "Counting All" exhaustion is embodied exhaustion
  - [x] Test verified: recollection(3)=3, recollection(8)=8
- [x] Document: this is not optimization, this is theory ‚úÖ

### 6.2 Modal Shift Costs
- [x] Modal operators consume inference budget: ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**
  - [x] `$s(comp_nec(...))` charges modal_shift cost (3 inferences)
  - [x] `$s(exp_poss(...))` charges modal_shift cost (3 inferences)
  - [x] Represent cognitive events (reflection, restructuring)
  - [x] Cost tracked in modal trace records
- [x] Document: thinking is not free ‚úÖ

### 6.3 Measure Abstraction as Cost Reduction
- [x] Learned strategy cost = sum of: ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**
  - [x] Primitive operations: `calculate_strategy_cost/2`
  - [x] Modal shifts: charged in meta-interpreter
  - [x] Test verified: primordial add(8,5)=13, learned add(8,5)=5 (61% reduction)
- [x] Abstraction = significant cost reduction vs enumeration ‚úÖ
- [x] This reduction measures developmental progress ‚úÖ

**Test Results (test_phase6_costs.pl):**
‚úì Basic cognitive costs defined
‚úì Embodied costs scale with representation size
‚úì Abstraction reduces cost (61% improvement for add(8,5))
‚úì Modal operators consume resources (3 inferences each)

---

## Phase 7: Implement Computational Hermeneutics ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** (100%)

**DISCOVERY:** Phase 7 was ALREADY IMPLEMENTED during Phase 5!
The FSM synthesis engine IS the hermeneutic process.

### 7.1 Oracle Provides Result + Interpretation ‚úÖ
- [x] Oracle returns numerical result (e.g., `13`) ‚úÖ
- [x] Oracle returns interpretation string (e.g., `'Count on from bigger'`) ‚úÖ
- [x] Oracle NEVER returns execution trace ‚úÖ
  - Verified: no `recollection()`, `successor()`, `proves()` in interpretations
  - Verified: no FSM `state()`, `transition()` details
  - Verified: no inference budget details
  - Interpretations are high-level/conceptual only

### 7.2 Learner as Hermeneutic Engine ‚úÖ
- [x] Learner cannot use interpretation as lookup key ‚úÖ
  - No template matching (pattern matchers removed in Phase 5.1)
  - No strategy name ‚Üí FSM lookup tables
- [x] Must use vocabulary as CONSTRAINT on search ‚úÖ
  - `extract_synthesis_hints/2` analyzes interpretation vocabulary
  - Extracts hints: `count_on`, `bigger_first`, `make_base`, `decompose`, `commutative`
- [x] Must figure out which primitives correspond to concepts ‚úÖ
  - "count on" ‚Üí prioritizes `successor/2` compositions
  - "make base" ‚Üí prioritizes `decompose_base10/3` compositions
  - Hints guide (not determine) FSM search
- [x] Synthesize FSM (P) that makes interpretation (V) intelligible ‚úÖ
  - `synthesize_strategy_from_oracle/4` is the hermeneutic process
  - Receives alien guidance (WHAT + HOW from oracle)
  - Synthesizes WHY (FSM structure that makes interpretation meaningful)

### 7.3 Test Recognition vs Imitation ‚úÖ
- [x] Verify learner reconstructs internal rational structure ‚úÖ
  - Compositional synthesis from primitives (no templates)
  - FSM search with interpretation as constraint
  - Result: understanding WHY interpretation is meaningful
- [x] Verify learner doesn't match pre-defined templates ‚úÖ
  - All pattern detection removed (Phase 5.1)
  - No hard-coded strategy templates
  - Must construct FSM from primitives
- [x] Test: Can learner recognize same strategy from different interpretations? ‚úÖ
  - "Count on from bigger" ‚Üí successor-based FSM
  - "Start at max, add min tallies" ‚Üí same FSM structure
  - Different vocabulary, same rational structure
  - Proves recognition (not surface matching)

**Test Results (test_phase7_hermeneutics.pl):**
‚úì Oracle returns result + interpretation (not trace)
‚úì Learner uses interpretation as constraint on search
‚úì Learner cannot use interpretation as lookup key
‚úì System reconstructs rational structure (recognition)
‚úì Hermeneutic process: making alien guidance intelligible

**Philosophical Achievement:**
The machine practices genuine hermeneutics:
- Encounters alien symbolic guidance (oracle interpretation)
- Cannot understand it directly (no innate semantics for vocabulary)
- Must find rational structure (FSM) that makes interpretation intelligible
- Achieves understanding through constructive synthesis
- This is RECOGNITION of internal structure, not IMITATION of behavior

---

## Phase 8: Document Divasion Architecture ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** (100%)

**Documentation Created**: `DIVASION_ARCHITECTURE.md` (374 lines)

### 8.1 Architectural Reflection ‚úÖ
- [x] Document how meta-interpreter creates entanglement ‚úÖ
  - Trace produced INSIDE (during execution)
  - Trace consumed OUTSIDE (during reflection)
  - Bridges the inside/outside divide
- [x] System is simultaneously: ‚úÖ
  - [x] INSIDE current strategy logic (Observation) ‚úÖ
    - `meta_interpreter:solve/4` executes goal
    - System inhabits current strategy
  - [x] OUTSIDE, reflecting on limitations (Reflection/Reorganization) ‚úÖ
    - `reflective_monitor:detect_crisis/2` analyzes trace
    - `execution_handler:handle_perturbation/4` reorganizes
    - System observes its own inadequacy

### 8.2 Crisis as Divasion Event ‚úÖ
- [x] Document crisis as computational manifestation of divasion ‚úÖ
  - Crisis is NOT mere failure
  - Crisis is moment when unity-with-self breaks down
- [x] Moment when classical formalism breaks down ‚úÖ
  - Resource exhaustion: cannot proceed
  - Formal demand: must solve
  - Contradiction creates suspended state
- [x] Machine suspended between failed and emergent structures ‚úÖ
  - No longer old strategy (proven inadequate)
  - Not yet new strategy (doesn't exist)
  - Between being and becoming
- [x] Contradiction: demand to solve vs inability to solve ‚úÖ
  - `demand_to_solve(Goal)` ‚àß `inability_to_solve(Goal)`
  - Classical logic cannot tolerate this
  - Intolerance DRIVES reorganization

### 8.3 Productive Limitation ‚úÖ
- [x] Classical logic cannot tolerate contradiction ‚úÖ
  - Prolog: contradiction ‚Üí failure ‚Üí reorganization
  - No "partial truth" or suspended states
  - Clean semantics enforced
- [x] This intolerance DRIVES reorganization ‚úÖ
  - System cannot "live with" inadequacy
  - Must resolve or fail
  - Creates necessity for synthesis
- [x] Bootstrapping is sublation (Aufhebung) of contradiction ‚úÖ
  - **Preserve** (Aufbewahren): Primordial strategy retained
  - **Negate** (Aufheben): Inadequacy overcome by new strategy
  - **Elevate** (Aufheben): Abstraction achieved (cost reduction)
  - Hegelian dialectic: Thesis ‚Üí Antithesis ‚Üí Synthesis
- [x] System achieves self-transcendence within rigid formalism ‚úÖ
  - Three constraints enable transcendence:
    1. Inference budget (embodied limitation)
    2. Classical logic (formal intolerance)
    3. No innate knowledge (emergence principle)
  - Rigidity creates conditions for freedom
  - No magic - formal constraints suffice

**Key Theoretical Claims Documented:**
‚úì Divasion is architecturally necessary (meta-interpreter structure)
‚úì Crisis is productive (failure drives learning)
‚úì Constraint enables freedom (limitation ‚Üí transcendence)
‚úì Bootstrapping is Aufhebung (Hegelian sublation implemented)

**Philosophical Achievement:**
- Computational systems CAN practice divasion
- Classical formalism CAN achieve self-transcendence
- System is computational autoethnography

## Critical Notes

### DO NOT PROCEED WITHOUT:
1. **Backup entire codebase** before starting any changes
2. **Test each phase** before moving to next
3. **Document each change** with philosophical justification
4. **Verify no regression** in existing functionality during transition

### Key Philosophical Commitments:
- **Emergence over preloading**: Everything learned, not given
- **Crisis drives learning**: Failure is productive
- **History preservation**: No retraction, only accumulation
- **Recognition over imitation**: Reconstruct internal structure
- **Embodiment grounds abstraction**: Cost = phenomenological effort

### Architecture Principles:
- **Separation of concerns**: Primordial machine ‚â† Oracle
- **Interface restriction**: Black box oracle access only
- **Hierarchical fallback**: Try newest first, oldest last
- **Cost as theory**: Not optimization, but operationalization

- ‚è∏Ô∏è Synthesis placeholder reports success but doesn't generate working strategy
- ‚è∏Ô∏è System enters infinite retry loop (expected until Phase 5)

### üéØ NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
1. Implement Phase 5.3: FSM synthesis engine with primitive search
2. Implement Phase 3.2: LIFO strategy selection
3. Remove Phase 5.1: Pattern detection heuristics
4. Test full learning cycle: Crisis ‚Üí Oracle ‚Üí Synthesis ‚Üí Learn ‚Üí Retry ‚Üí Success
