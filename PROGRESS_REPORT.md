# UMEDCA Refactoring Progress Report
## Date: October 1, 2025

## ✅ COMPLETED PHASES

### Phase 1: Primordial Machine Bootstrap Kernel
**Status:** COMPLETE ✅  
**Commit:** `12e0b42`

**Accomplishments:**
- ✅ Created `primordial_start.pl` entry point
- ✅ Set `max_inferences(10)` in config.pl
- ✅ Simplified `object_level.pl` to ONLY add/3 (Counting All)
- ✅ Removed subtract/3, multiply/3, divide/3
- ✅ Reset `learned_knowledge.pl` to pristine state
- ✅ Modified `execution_handler.pl`: learning ONLY on crisis
- ✅ Created `crisis_curriculum_primordial.txt`
- ✅ Created comprehensive `REFACTORING_CHECKLIST.md`

**Philosophical Validation:**
- Implements "Sense-Certainty" stage
- Enforces finite/infinite dialectic
- Built to Break: failure drives learning
- Architectural enforcement: operations must be learned

---

### Phase 4: Oracle Server - Normative Strategy Black Box
**Status:** COMPLETE ✅  
**Commit:** `fdd61eb`

**Accomplishments:**
- ✅ Created `oracle_server.pl` with `query_oracle/4` interface
- ✅ BLACK BOX ENFORCEMENT: Returns only result + interpretation (no traces)
- ✅ Implemented `execute_strategy/6` for sar_add_* modules
- ✅ Added `extract_interpretation/7` with linguistic descriptions
- ✅ Supports 4 addition strategies: COBO, RMB, Chunking, Rounding
- ✅ Added `list_available_strategies/2`

**Testing:**
```prolog
?- query_oracle(add(8,5), 'RMB', R, I).
R = 13,
I = 'Rearrange to make base 10: Start at 8, move units from 5 to reach 10, then add remainder to get 13'.

?- query_oracle(add(8,5), 'COBO', R, I).
R = 13,
I = 'Count on from bigger: Start at max(8,5), count up min(8,5) times to reach 13'.
```

**Philosophical Validation:**
- Oracle represents normative/cultural mathematics
- Primordial machine observes vocabulary (V) but must reconstruct practice (P)
- Computational hermeneutics: recognition over template matching
- Black box forces genuine synthesis, not introspection

---

### Phase 2 (Partial): Oracle Integration into Crisis Cycle
**Status:** IN PROGRESS ⏸️  
**Not Yet Committed**

**Accomplishments:**
- ✅ Modified `execution_handler.pl` to load oracle_server
- ✅ Enhanced `handle_perturbation` to consult oracle on crisis
- ✅ Added `consult_oracle_for_solution/3` helper
- ✅ Added `peano_to_int/2` converter
- ✅ Created `synthesize_from_oracle/1` placeholder
- ✅ Created `test_oracle_integration.pl` test file

**Current Behavior:**
When resource_exhaustion occurs:
1. ✅ System detects crisis
2. ✅ System consults oracle  
3. ✅ Oracle returns result + interpretation
4. ⏸️ System attempts synthesis (currently uses old pattern matcher as placeholder)
5. ⏸️ Synthesis usually fails (expected - Phase 5 needed)

**Output Example:**
```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  CRISIS: Resource Exhaustion Detected
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  Failed Goal: object_level:add(s(s(...)),s(s(...)),_)
  Initiating Oracle Consultation...

  Oracle Result: 13
  Oracle Says: "Rearrange to make base 10: Start at 8, move units from 5..."
  
  Attempting to synthesize strategy from oracle guidance...
  [synthesis attempts...]
```

## ⏸️ REMAINING PHASES

### Phase 5: Transform Learner into Synthesis Engine
**Status:** NOT STARTED ⏸️  
**Priority:** HIGH (Required for functional learning)

**Required Work:**
1. Remove pattern detection from `more_machine_learner.pl`:
   - Delete `detect_cob_pattern/2`
   - Delete `detect_rmb_pattern/2`
   - Delete `detect_doubles_pattern/2`
   - Delete all `construct_and_validate_*` predicates

2. Implement `synthesize_strategy/4`:
   - Input: Goal, FailedTrace, TargetResult, TargetInterpretation
   - Output: New run_learned_strategy/5 clause
   - Method: FSM search using primitives (successor, predecessor, decompose_base10)
   - Constraints: Must produce TargetResult within max_inferences limit

3. Implement FSM search engine:
   - Search space: all possible FSMs
   - Building blocks: grounded_utils primitives
   - Heuristics: Use TargetInterpretation to guide search
   - Validation: Test synthesized FSM produces correct result

4. Define meta-abilities:
   - Segmentation/analysis of failed traces
   - Recombination of primitives
   - Generalization (variabilization)

**Why This is Critical:**
Without Phase 5, the system cannot learn from crises. It can detect them, consult the oracle, but cannot synthesize new strategies. The current placeholder just calls the old pattern matcher, which often fails.

---

### Phase 3.2: Re-architect Strategy Invocation Hierarchy
**Status:** NOT STARTED ⏸️  
**Priority:** MEDIUM (Required after Phase 5)

**Required Work:**
1. Modify `execution_handler.pl` or `more_machine_learner.pl`:
   - Query learned strategies in reverse order (LIFO)
   - Try newest strategy first
   - Fallback through older strategies
   - Use primordial add/3 as last resort

2. Add strategy selection logging:
   - Log which strategy succeeded
   - Include strategy name in output
   - Makes developmental stage visible

**Why This is Important:**
Creates "geological record" of development. Newest strategies tried first, preserving full learning history without retraction.

---

### Phase 3.1: Ensure No Retraction of Strategies
**Status:** MOSTLY COMPLETE ✅  
**Note:** Need to verify no retract/1 calls exist

**Required Work:**
1. Audit `more_machine_learner.pl` for retract/1 calls
2. Ensure only assertz/1 is used
3. Verify learned_knowledge.pl accumulates (never shrinks)

---

### Phase 6: Define Cost Function
**Status:** NOT STARTED ⏸️  
**Priority:** LOW (Optimization, not critical path)

**Required Work:**
1. Make recollection operations cost proportional to list length
2. Modal operators consume inference budget
3. Measure abstraction as cost reduction

**Why This Matters:**
Operationalizes theory of embodiment. Cost = phenomenological effort, not just optimization metric.

---

### Phase 7: Implement Computational Hermeneutics
**Status:** PARTIALLY COMPLETE ✅  
**Note:** Oracle provides interpretation, synthesis engine will use it

**Current State:**
- ✅ Oracle returns interpretation strings
- ⏸️ Synthesis engine doesn't yet use them as constraints

**Required Work (Phase 5):**
1. Parse interpretation string for concepts
2. Map concepts to primitive operations
3. Use as heuristic to guide FSM search

---

## CURRENT SYSTEM STATE

### What Works:
1. ✅ Primordial machine loads and runs
2. ✅ Only add/3 via "Counting All" available
3. ✅ max_inferences=10 enforces crisis on add(8,5)
4. ✅ Crisis detection triggers oracle consultation
5. ✅ Oracle returns correct results and interpretations
6. ✅ Black box constraint enforced (no internal traces exposed)

### What Doesn't Work Yet:
1. ⏸️ **Synthesis from oracle guidance** - Uses placeholder that often fails
2. ⏸️ **Learning new strategies** - Cannot generate FSMs from constraints
3. ⏸️ **Strategy hierarchy** - No LIFO selection, no fallback chain
4. ⏸️ **Crisis resolution** - System enters infinite retry loop

### Expected Behavior (Correct for Current Phase):
- ✅ Detects add(8,5) exceeds limit
- ✅ Triggers resource_exhaustion
- ✅ Consults oracle successfully  
- ⏸️ Fails to synthesize (EXPECTED - Phase 5 needed)
- ⏸️ Infinite retry (EXPECTED - will resolve after Phase 5)

---

## NEXT STEPS

### Immediate Priority: Phase 5 - Synthesis Engine

**Step 1:** Remove pattern detection heuristics
```prolog
% DELETE from more_machine_learner.pl:
detect_cob_pattern/2
detect_rmb_pattern/2  
detect_doubles_pattern/2
construct_and_validate_cob/2
construct_and_validate_rmb/3
construct_and_validate_doubles/2
```

**Step 2:** Implement `synthesize_strategy/4`
```prolog
synthesize_strategy(Goal, FailedTrace, TargetResult, TargetInterpretation) :-
    % 1. Analyze FailedTrace to understand what failed
    % 2. Use TargetResult as hard constraint
    % 3. Use TargetInterpretation to guide search
    % 4. Search FSM space using primitives
    % 5. Generate transition/4 rules
    % 6. Validate FSM produces TargetResult within limit
    % 7. Assert new run_learned_strategy/5 clause
```

**Step 3:** Implement FSM search
```prolog
search_fsm_space(Goal, Constraints, FSM) :-
    % Generate candidate FSMs
    % Test against constraints
    % Return first valid FSM
```

**Step 4:** Test full cycle
```prolog
% Should now work:
?- run_computation(add(8,5), 10).
% Crisis → Oracle → Synthesis → Success → Retry → Works!
```

### After Phase 5: Phase 3.2 - Strategy Hierarchy
Then implement LIFO strategy selection with primordial fallback.

---

## TESTING PLAN

### Phase 5 Testing:
1. **Test synthesis with single problem:**
   ```prolog
   ?- run_computation(add(8,5), 10).
   % Should: Crisis → Oracle → Synthesize → Learn → Success
   ```

2. **Test strategy persistence:**
   ```prolog
   ?- run_computation(add(8,5), 10).  % First time - learns
   ?- run_computation(add(8,5), 10).  % Second time - uses learned
   % Second should be fast (no crisis)
   ```

3. **Test generalization:**
   ```prolog
   ?- run_computation(add(7,6), 10).   % Similar problem
   ?- run_computation(add(3,8), 10).   % Tests commutativity
   ```

4. **Run full curriculum:**
   ```prolog
   ?- process_curriculum('crisis_curriculum_primordial.txt').
   % Should learn progressively through all stages
   ```

### Phase 3.2 Testing:
1. **Test strategy hierarchy:**
   - Load multiple strategies
   - Verify newest tried first
   - Verify primordial is last resort

2. **Test geological record:**
   - Inspect learned_knowledge.pl
   - Verify chronological layering
   - Verify no retractions occurred

## PHILOSOPHICAL VALIDATION

### What We've Achieved Philosophically:

1. **Sense-Certainty Stage** ✅
   - System begins with pure immediacy (enumerate-based counting)
   - Treats numbers as particular collections, not abstractions
   - Will encounter contradiction (add(8,5) failure)

2. **Finite/Infinite Dialectic** ✅
   - max_inferences(10) is explicit finitude
   - Curriculum presents infinite demand
   - Crisis = finite cannot contain infinite

3. **Built to Break** ✅
   - Learning only on failure, not success
   - System must fail to force change
   - No proactive optimization

4. **Normative Oracle as Cultural Knowledge** ✅
   - Oracle = culturally established mathematics
   - Black box = external observation only
   - Must reconstruct internal rationality

5. **Computational Hermeneutics** ✅ (Partial)
   - Oracle provides vocabulary (V)
   - System must reconstruct practice (P)
   - Recognition, not template matching
   - (Needs Phase 5 to complete)

6. **Architectural Emergence** ✅
   - Operations removed, must be learned
   - No innate strategy knowledge
   - Geological record ready (Phase 3.2)

### What Remains Philosophically:

1. **Genuine Synthesis** ⏸️ (Phase 5)
   - Currently uses pattern matching (old way)
   - Needs true FSM generation from constraints
   - Recognition as reconstruction of rationality

2. **Sublation (Aufhebung)** ⏸️ (Phase 3.2)
   - Old strategies preserved, not erased
   - Negated by failure, uplifted to new form
   - Geological developmental record

3. **Divasion (Inside/Outside)** ✅ (Architectural)
   - Meta-interpreter creates entanglement
   - System inside current logic, outside in reflection
   - Crisis suspends between structures

---

## SUMMARY

**We have successfully:**
1. Built the primordial machine (Phase 1)
2. Created the normative oracle (Phase 4)  
3. Integrated oracle into crisis cycle (Phase 2 partial)

**We still need:**
1. **Phase 5: Synthesis Engine** (CRITICAL - blocks functional learning)
2. Phase 3.2: Strategy Hierarchy (Important after Phase 5)
3. Phase 6: Cost Function (Optimization, lower priority)

**The system is architecturally sound and philosophically grounded.**  
**The next critical step is Phase 5: implementing the FSM synthesis engine.**

This will transform the system from detecting crises to actually resolving them through genuine learning.

---

**Next Command:** Implement Phase 5 - FSM Synthesis Engine
