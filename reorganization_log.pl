/** <module> Reorganization and Cognitive Process Logger
 *
 * This module provides a logging facility for the ORR (Observe, Reorganize,
 * Reflect) cycle. It captures key events during the cognitive process,
 * such as the start of a cycle, detection of disequilibrium, and the
 * success or failure of reorganization attempts.
 *
 * The log can be retrieved as a raw list of events or generated as a
 * human-readable narrative report using a Definite Clause Grammar (DCG).
 *
 * Log entries are stored as dynamic facts of the form:
 * `log_entry(Timestamp, Event)`.

%!      log_event(+Event:term) is det.
%
%       Records a structured event in the log with a current timestamp.
%
%       @param Event The structured term representing the event to be logged
%       (e.g., `disequilibrium(trigger_term)`).

%!      get_log(-Log:list) is det.
%
%       Retrieves the entire log as a list of `log_entry/2` facts.
%
%       @param Log A list of all `log_entry(Timestamp, Event)` terms currently
%       in the database.
get_log(Log) :-
    findall(log_entry(T, E), log_entry(T, E), Log).

%!      clear_log is det.
%
%       Clears all entries from the reorganization log by retracting all
%       `log_entry/2` facts. This is typically done before starting a new
%       `run_query/1`.
clear_log :-

%!      generate_report(-Report:string) is det.
%
%       Translates the current log into a single, human-readable narrative string.
%       It uses a DCG to convert the structured log events into descriptive sentences.

%       @param Report The generated narrative report as a string.
