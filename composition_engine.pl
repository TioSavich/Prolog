/** <module> Composition Engine for Grounded Fractional Arithmetic
 *
 * This module implements the embodied act of grouping for fractional arithmetic.
 * It provides the core functionality for finding and extracting copies of units
 * from quantities, which is essential for the equivalence rules in fractional 
 * reasoning.
 *
 * The composition engine supports the grounded approach to fractional arithmetic
 * by treating grouping as a cognitive action with associated costs.
