/** <module> Student Addition Strategy: Counting On by Bases and Ones (COBO)
 *
 * This module implements the 'Counting On by Bases and then Ones' (COBO)
 * strategy for multi-digit addition, modeled as a finite state machine.
 * This strategy involves decomposing one number (B) into its base-10
 * components and then incrementally counting on from the other number (A).
 *
 * The process is as follows:
 * 1. Decompose B into a number of 'bases' (tens) and 'ones'.
 * 2. Starting with A, count on by ten for each base.
 * 3. After all bases are added, count on by one for each one.
 *
 * The state of the automaton is represented by the term:
 * `state(StateName, Sum, BaseCounter, OneCounter)`
 *
 * The history of execution is captured as a list of steps:
 * `step(StateName, CurrentSum, BaseCounter, OneCounter, Interpretation)`
 *

%       Executes the 'Counting On by Bases and Ones' (COBO) addition strategy for A + B.
%
%       This predicate initializes the state machine and runs it until it
%       reaches the accept state. It traces the execution, providing a
%       step-by-step history of how the sum was computed by first counting
%       on by tens, and then by ones.
%
%       @param A The first addend, the number to start counting from.
%       @param B The second addend, which is decomposed into bases and ones.
%       @param FinalSum The resulting sum of A and B.
%       @param History A list of `step/5` terms that describe the state
%       machine's execution path and the interpretation of each step.
